                    Much of infant and maternal mortality stems from problems arisen during pregnancy or childbirth.
                    <br>
                    With women often bearing the brunt of economic crisis, it is not surprising to observe a higher
                    number of fragile pregnancies in the south of Italy. Women in the south are at least 30% more likely
                    to have a miscarriage, according to data from ISTAT. The gap has actually increased significantly
                    since the 1980s. The rate of miscarriages among women aged 15-49 has remained stable or declined in
                    the north and most of the centre, but it has grown in the Mezzogiorno. In Sardinia, for example, the
                    rate of women experiencing a miscarriage is almost double today compared to the 1980s.</p>
                <p>
                    The average age of first-time mothers has increased everywhere in Italy – it was almost 32 years old
                    in 2017 – with no significant regional differences. age is a significant risk factor in high
                    pregnancy termination, but it doesn’t seem to be higher in the south. Therefore, the explanation
                    must lie elsewhere. Material deprivation, physical and psychological stress can lead to early
                    pregnancy termination and can affect both the woman and the child’s health after birth.</p>
                <p>
                    Effective prevention also relies on an efficient, trustworthy healthcare system to provide it.
                    Having access to timely and appropriate healthcare during pregnancies greatly improves women’s
                    chances of carrying a healthy pregnancy to term. In a country where healthcare is a universal right,
                    this shouldn’t be an issue. Unfortunately, the economic realities of recession and funding cuts have
                    forced providers to slash their budgets, cutting services and personnel. Maternal care units may not
                    be available at the nearest hospital, or they might not be fully equipped for emergency situations,
                    like high-risk pregnancies.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2010, the national government approved a law demanding regions shut down birth centres with fewer
                    than 500 births a year and reduce the numbers of those with fewer than 1,000. In 2011, a
                    parliamentary commission conducted a first survey of birth centres to identify those that were at
                    risk.</p>
                <p>
                    Based on responses from 17 regions, the final report identified at least 86 birth centres with fewer
                    than 500 births a year. Half of these centres were in Campania, Sicily and Apulia – all of them in
                    the south. Collectively, these 86 centres accounted for just over 300 births in 2010. In Campania
                    and Apulia, these smaller facilities made up more than half of all birth centres.</p>
                <p>
                    As part of the government’s plan to rationalise the healthcare structure, regions were required to
                    report on the birth centres on their territory and outline steps to shut them down or merge them.
                    When specific circumstances arose, regions could request an exemption if the facility served an
                    isolated or deprived area. This, however, is the exception, rather than the rule. Nor is it a
                    permanent guarantee against closure.</p>
                <p>
                    In 2014, of the 16 small centres in Campania, 10 benefited from an exemption. Nonetheless, in late
                    2018, three of them – all in deprived areas – were shut down.</p>
                <p>
                    In other cases, the regional government is trying to balance the need to cut expenditure and comply
                    with the rules, on the one hand, with pressure from families and medical staff. Thus, in Sardinia,
                    more than half of the 17 birth centres were classified as small in 2014, and their fate is still on
                    the line.
                    <p>
                        The outgoing – centre-left – government was in favour of rationalising maternal care units. The
                        former health minister, Luigi Arru, argued the changes would not affect the quality and
                        accessibility of care. Instead, providers should link up and pool resources to grant efficient,
                        high-quality services.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, he allegedly entered into talks with Rome to grant an
                        exemption to some of the facilities threatened with closure. The centre-right is now in power,
                        but it doesn’t seem to have changed things. What is more, the new minister sticks to his
                        predecessor’s line and has made no promises over the future of small birth centres. One in
                        particular, at the “Paolo Merlo” hospital in the small island of La Maddalena, could shut down
                        any time now.</p>
                        <p>
                        Last year, there were only three births at the centre. In this specific case, even national
                        gynaecologists’ organisations weighed in, claiming the facility isn’t safe and shouldn’t be
                        used. In a letter to the Sardinian government, they pointed out the centre lacked essential
                        services that made it unable to face emergency situations effectively. They also emphasised that
                        “discussion over the birth centre at La Maddalena cannot and should not be conditioned by
                        political games or economic imperatives. Instead, we should first and foremost consider the
                        safety of women and children.”</p>
                        <p>
                        With maternal care turning into a game of political football between Sardinia and the capital,
                        this doesn’t always appear to be the priority.
