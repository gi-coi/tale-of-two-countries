                <p>
                    Before being an immigration hub, Italy was a land of emigration. In many ways, it still is.</p>
                <p>What
                    became known as the “Italian diaspora” began shortly after the country was unified. Between 1876 and
                    1914, almost 14 million people, mostly from the North-east, moved to continental Europe. Overtime,
                    emigration from southern Italy became more prominent, and it already accounted for 47 percent of
                    outflows by 1913. Most emigration from the Mezzogiorno was transatlantic, to North and South America
                    and Australia.</p>
                <p>At this stage, migrants tended to be men, young and low-skilled. They often came from
                    agriculture and left the country looking for better economic conditions. They were mainly employed
                    in mining and construction. Later on, more high-skilled workers began emigrating, often with their
                    families.
                </p>
                <p>After World War II, a new wave of migrations began. This time, however, it was mainly internal. The
                    accelerated economic growth starting in the 1950s – the average income grew 130% between 1952 and
                    1970 – was driven by the North, though the Mezzogiorno slowly caught up.</p>
                <p>At this time, at least 9 million people moved from the South to the North of Italy, chasing the
                    promise of the post-war “economic miracle”. There were many more illegal migrants who couldn’t
                    change their official place of residence, due to a fascist-era anti-urbanisation law, abolished in
                    1961.<br>
                    Far from stemming migration, this law only made it covert. Entire families left the Mezzogiorno and
                    settled in the industrial North – especially the so-called Industrial Triangle area between Turin,
                    Milan and Genoa.</p>
                <p>The post-war exodus had a profound impact on Italian society, economy and culture. For northerners
                    and southerners alike, this encounter was a cultural shock. The tropes of the “Polentone” – middle
                    class, hard-working snob – and the “Terrone” – lazy, dirty and dishonest – are still part of the
                    Italian language and culture.</p>
                <p>These historical movements have also generated a new pattern of healthcare migration.</p>
                <p>
                    Healthcare migration – formally known as interregional health mobility – occurs when a resident in
                    one region accesses the healthcare services in a different region. Hospital admissions and
                    outpatient procedures make up the majority of cases, but it includes anything from specialist care
                    to medical exams and drug prescriptions.
                </p>
                <p>It existence is a right in law and protects patients' freedom of choice. It is also a vehicle for economic and social inequality.</p>
