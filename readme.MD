<h1>A Tale of Two Countries. Dissecting Italy's healthcare gap</h1>
<p><em>A tale of Two Countries</em> is a journalistic investigation into healthcare inequalities in Italy.</p>
<p>There's an invisible line that cuts across Italy. Below this line is the Mezzogiorno: a geographic label which has turned into an identity and a political issue.</p>
<p>Why do people in the South of Italy live shorter, less healthy lives?</p>
<p>Who are Italy's "healthcare tourists"?</p>
<p>What happened at a small chemical plant at the heart of Sardinia, and what are workers fighting for?</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>My name is Giovanna, I'm 26 and I'm a graduate in political science and data journalism.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in rural Sardinia, but I've been on the move for a while, now. After moving to Cardiff, UK for one year, I'm now living and working in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>I'm an annoying nerd who enjoys building stuff and web development. When I'm not coding, I spend my time reading, taking photos and making pancakes. If you need me, you can always find me at a hipster caf√©, sipping a good espresso and people-watching.</p>
