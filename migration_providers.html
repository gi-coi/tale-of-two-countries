                <p></p>Regional healthcare services owed nearly €1.2 billion in mobility debts in 2018, following a
                political
                settlement between regional governments. With only 7 out of 20 providers recording a surplus – and
                only one of them in the South – the mobility credit system reinforces the disparities in the
                national healthcare network, benefiting richer, more attractive regions, and draining resources from
                those that are already underfunded. With the volume of interregional mobility having grown from €3.9
                billion in 2013 to €4.6 billion in 2018, the gap is expected to widen in the future.

                </p>
                <p>The idea behind
                    healthcare mobility is to encourage competition between regional healthcare systems. Less attractive
                    providers would be compelled to invest more money into their services, improve their quality and
                    retain more patients. </p>
                <p>However, instead of balancing out, the healthcare migration flows from the
                    South to the North are growing and the funding gap is widening as a result. A healthcare provider
                    receives an amount of money for each service delivered. When a resident in one region receives a
                    service in another region, the latter accumulates credit. These debit and credit flows are settled
                    through political and technical agreements among regions, the latest of which was approved in June
                    2019. </p>
                <p>According to figures published in 2018, seven regions had a mobility surplus. Four are in the
                    north, two – Tuscany and Umbria – in the centre, and only one – Molise – in the south. Together,
                    they had credits for more than €2.8 billion – 60% of all mobility credit generated in the country.
                    Lombardy alone accumulated nearly €1.2 billion in credit and had the largest net migration surplus.
                </p>
                <p>The regions with the highest deficit, with the exception of Lazio (€289 million) are all in the
                    Mezzogiorno. Calabria’s deficit exceeds €302 million, and Campania’s is over €290 million. The
                    Mezzogiorno’s net migration debt of almost €1.2 is significantly higher than the Centre’s €263
                    million. The North’s overall surplus exceeds €1 billion, almost mirroring the deficit in the rest of
                    the country.</p>
                <h2>Mobility compensations</h2>
                <p>Mobility compensations reinforce the inequalities of a system that has historically tilted towards
                    the northern regions.</p>
                <p>In theory, the amount due to each region should be calculated based on demographic – population
                    weighed by age and gender – and socio-economic criteria. In practice, for the last fifteen years,
                    only the former have been applied, benefitting regions with older populations – namely those in the
                    North, thanks to higher life expectancy.                   
                </p>
                <p>Since 2012, regions have also agreed to performance-based criteria, with no counterbalance to
                    account for southern regions’ structural disadvantage. The gap has kept on widening because some
                    regional governments had a vested interest in preserving the rules as they were. At a time of cuts
                    to public services, including healthcare, agreeing to a redistribution would mean losing a piece of
                    the cake.</p>
                <p> In 2017, regions finally agreed to introduce compensation criteria that for regions’ deprivation.
                    This is a first step in the direction of a more equal funding system, although other regions – such
                    as Veneto – are pushing for stronger performance-based rewards.</p>
                <p> With more resources in their budgets, these providers get additional funding on top of what they
                    receive from the government. They can then circumvent public expenditure limits, using own
                    resources, to hire personnel, improve the quality of their services and facilities, or provide
                    highly specialised care. According to a 2018 study, regional healthcare systems in the Mezzogiorno
                    rely more on public funding than in the North, because they earn less from other sources – like
                    interregional mobility.</p>
                <p>Partly as a consequence of this, but also because many have undergone financial restructuring plans,
                    they have limited spending power. Personnel cuts have created another gap between the north and the
                    south. While hiring expenditure grew 23% in the north between 2003 and 2018, it only increased 8.5%
                    in the south, and even declined in some regions, like Campania.</p>
                    <h2>How to break the cycle</h2>
                <p>In sum, healthcare migration creates a vicious cycle for regional healthcare systems in the
                    Mezzogiorno. They are charged with a double expenditure, having to fund their own providers while
                    paying out for services in other regions. They are forced to cut corners – machinery, extra
                    services, staff – and they tend to become even less attractive among residents. What is more, their
                    bedspace supply keeps shrinking, because regional authorities lose beds if they have negative
                    migration, and gain them if they have positive migration.</p>
                <p>   Public bedspace has been slashed by about 75% since 1981. Between 2010 and 2017 alone, the total
                    bedspace supply was cut by almost 33,000 units – 28,000 of which in the public sector. Calabria and
                    Apulia cut more than 25% of their bedspace. If healthcare migration keep fleeing the Mezzogiorno,
                    the situation will get worse.</p>
                <p> What is needed, many argue, is a complete redesign of the funding system that accounts for existing
                    differences among healthcare providers. “One size fits all” has proven detrimental, especially in
                    times of cuts to public services. Some regional governments advocate for a cap to healthcare
                    migration on certain procedures, like ____.</p>
