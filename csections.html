                <h1>Curbing the "c-section epidemic"</h1>
                <h2>What is happening in Southern Italy's delivery rooms?</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Claudia was 18 when she had her first child.</p>
                <p>“I had been in labour for six hours, but they couldn’t
                    see
                    the baby’s head," she recalls. "Then a doctor told me, ‘That’s it, we need to cut.’”</p>
                <p>Claudia was brought into the
                    operating room just after midnight. Soon after, she had a c-section and delivered her baby.</p>
                <p>“They
                    didn’t
                    explain why they were doing it," she adds. " I had no idea what was going on. Six hours isn’t that
                    long, is it?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The experience scarred her and left her traumatised. In her second pregnancy in 2018, Claudia was
                    determined to take control of her treatment.</p>
                <p>“I told my gynaecologist I wanted to program a
                    c-section," she says. "Initially he tried to persuade me otherwise, but then agreed with me and
                    supported my decision.”
                    Together they planned a date and time, scheduling the procedure during her doctor’s shift. When
                    Claudia
                    was admitted to the hospital a few months later, she was confident.</p>
                <p>
                    “Some nurses at the hospital tried to persuade me to try with a natural birth… But I didn’t want to.
                    I
                    was too frightened, to be honest,” she says.</p>
                <p>
                    Claudia’s story isn’t unique. Every year, thousands of women in the South of Italy have a c-section
                    with
                    no medical justification, facing longer recovery, as well as higher risks of complications and
                    long-term
                    side effects.</p>
                <p>
                    In what experts describe as a “c-section epidemic”, some clinics in Southern Italy are performing
                    c-sections on up to 60% of women.</p>


                <div id='csectionGlobal' class='mapVis'></div>
                <h2>A global epidemic?</h2>
                <p>
                    According to a <a
                        href='https://www.worldcat.org/title/global-epidemiology-of-use-of-and-disparities-in-caesarean-sections/oclc/7878022667&referer=brief_results'
                        target='_blank'>2018 study</a>, the rate of c-sections worldwide has nearly doubled since the
                    turn of the
                    century, from 12% to 21% of all births in 2015. This is partly thanks to improvements in medical
                    techniques, which have made the procedure safer and more accessible. Women are having kids later in
                    life, and some may resort to IVF or similar procedures. These pregnancies are riskier for both the
                    woman
                    and the child and are more likely to require a caesarean.</p>
                <p>
                    The trend is raising alarm in the medical community, with concerns of c-sections for non-medical
                    reasons. The <a
                        href='https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal_perinatal_health/cs-statement/en/'
                        target='_blank'>World Health Organisation</a> has issued new guidelines, recommending c-sections
                    only when
                    they
                    are medically justified. While noting caesareans can improve survival in countries where rates are
                    below
                    10%, it found that high rates do not correlate with better outcomes for women and babies.</p>
                <p>
                    In Italy, the c-section rate has trebled from 10% in 1980 to around a third of all births
                    (33.8%) in 2017.
                    Italy has one of the highest rates for caesarean deliveries in the EU, and the <a
                        href='https://data.oecd.org/healthcare/caesarean-sections.htm' target='_blank'>fifth highest in
                        the
                        OECD.</a></p>
                <p>
                    Biological and demographic factors certainly play a role - Italy’s fertility rate is the lowest in
                    the
                    EU, and women tend to have their first child in their 30s. These causes alone, however, cannot
                    explain
                    the huge gap between Trento, where only one in five women has a c-section, and Campania, where 50%
                    of
                    women do.</p>
                <h2>Smaller maternal units at higher risk</h2>
                <p>
                    C-sections are also disproportionately more common in smaller maternal units, even though only a
                    minority of high-risk and pre-term pregnancies happen there. For these hospitals, which are often
                    less
                    equipped to face medical emergencies and may not be staffed 24/7, c-sections are almost a way to
                    make up
                    for these shortcomings.</p>
                <p>
                    “I know of c-sections being planned around the staff’s shifts, to make sure the whole team is
                    there
                    for the surgery," doctor N., a paediatrician in rural Sardinia, explains. "That way, if something
                    goes wrong, they can’t be accused of negligence. It’s a real
                    issue when you don’t have a gynaecologist or an anaesthesiologist available, so you need to make do
                    with
                    what you have.”</p>
                <p>Hospitals should guarantee a
                    full
                    medical team – gynaecologist, paediatrician, anaesthesiologist and obstetrician – around the clock,
                    but
                    it isn’t always the case.</p>
                <div id='csection_IT' class='mapVis'></div>
                <p>
                    Until a few years ago, small maternal units were <a
                        href='http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_pagineAree_4483_listaFile_itemName_3_file.pdf'
                        target='_blank'>far more common</a> in the Mezzogiorno. A parliamentary
                    commission found 86 hospitals in Italy accounted for just over 300 births every year. Half of them
                    were
                    in three Southern regions – Sicily, Apulia and Campania. Regional administrations <a
                        href='www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2011/01/18/11A00319/sg> ' target='_blank'>agreed</a> with
                    the government
                    they would close all maternal wards with fewer than 500 annual deliveries, with limited exceptions
                    for those
                    that served deprived or isolated areas.</p>
                <p>
                    Today, about a quarter of maternal care wards are classified as “small”. In <a
                        href='http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/documentazione/p6_2_2_1.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=2766'
                        target='_blank'>2015</a>, these 117 units
                    accounted for less than 5% of births. They are more common in isolated areas and in the Centre and
                    South of Italy. On average, they have 190 to 226 deliveries per year – less than a baby every two
                    days.</p>
                <p>
                    Many of these facilities don’t meet basic requirements. Only two of them have an intensive care unit
                    (NICU). Some do not offer <a href='https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/epidural/'
                        target='_blank'>epidurals</a> – an
                    injection to reduce pain during labour – or rooming in for
                    new
                    moms and their babies.</p>
                <p>
                    “In smaller hospitals, staff members gain less practical experience than those in larger facilities,
                    with more patients," Dr. Davide de Vita explains. "Some almost develop a ‘fear of the delivery
                    room’. Vaginal births are less
                    risky,
                    but they can be more unpredictable, and if you don’t experience them on a daily basis, it’s
                    difficult to
                    factor in all the variables and make snap decisions.”</p>
                <p>De Vita is a
                    gynaecologist at a hospital in Ischia, Campania, and is the regional secretary of <a
                        href='https://www.aogoi.it' target='_blank'>AOGOI</a>, a
                    gynaecologists’ and obstetricians’ scientific society. AOGOI has been at the forefront of efforts
                    to
                    curb the inappropriate use of c-sections, especially through training and awareness campaigns.</p>
                <h2>Defensive medicine</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike Claudia, Laura wasn’t a fan of c-sections. However, during her first pregnancy, she was
                    scheduled
                    for one.</p>
                <p>“I was almost eight months pregnant, and the doctor told me my baby wasn’t growing and we
                    needed to have a caesarean," she recalls. "I completely panicked. I asked him to wait another couple
                    of weeks, see
                    how
                    it would progress. Two weeks later, he told me we couldn’t wait any longer. He was very supportive,
                    he
                    explained what the procedure would involve and the risks behind it… But I couldn’t think straight. I
                    kept thinking ‘What if I die on the operating table?, Is the baby okay?’. It was awful. But I got
                    through it.”</p>
                <p>
                    Ten years later, Laura was pregnant again. This time, she was optimistic.</p>
                <p>“I felt really good about
                    it," she says. "I thought I could have a ‘natural birth’, this time.” But one day, her gynaecologist
                    told her there
                    was
                    a problem. Once again, the baby was too small. She was surprised, but she trusted her doctor's
                    judgment. He knew what was best for her and her son.</p>
                <p>
                    She was also more prepared, this time. The procedure went smoothly and she recovered more quickly than
                    her
                    first time.</p>
                <p>“I don’t know what they changed, but I’m glad they did,” she laughs. She glances at her baby, who is
                    sleeping in
                    the living room, now. He’s doing great and is growing fast.</p>
                <p>
                    “He’s growing much better than my first child, you see," she pauses. "It makes you wonder… Did I
                    really need this
                    surgery? Maybe, if I had been stronger, I could have requested a trial labour. But how could I know?
                    I’m
                    sure my doctor made the right call. You can’t really be too confident in these situations.”</p>
                <p>
                    “I feel doctors sometimes try to protect women from unnecessary stress,” Maria chimes in. She also
                    had
                    two c-sections almost ten years apart. “Maybe you could carry the pregnancy to term, go through 15
                    hours
                    of labour and then they’ll rush you to the operating table for an emergency c-section. Instead, if
                    you
                    know what will happen, you can prepare yourself for it.”</p>
                <p>
                    Gynaecologists and obstetricians are under significant pressure to protect both the woman and the
                    child, especially at critical moments like childbirth, where <a
                        href='https://www.europeristat.com/images/EPHR2015_web_hyperlinked_Euro-Peristat.pdf'
                        target='_blank'>most of maternal and infant deaths</a>
                    occur. They face a <a
                        href='http://blog.consulcesi.it/tutele_diritti_medico/quali-le-categorie-medici-maggior-rischio-contenzioso/'
                        target='_blank'>higher legal risk</a> than other specialists and they could be held personally
                    liable
                    in the most serious cases, like the death of the mother or child, or complications resulting in
                    permanent damage.</p>
                <p>This defensive approach to pregnancy can lead doctors to perform unnecessary medical procedures to
                    give their patients some peace of mind, while protecting themselves and the hospital from scrutiny.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In doing so, doctors may in fact expose their patients to <a
                        href='https://www.epicentro.iss.it/itoss/EpidMortMatGrave' target='_blank'>higher risks</a>.
                    Women who deliver with
                    c-section
                    have a slower recovery and are five times as likely to suffer serious complications during
                    childbirth.
                    They are also readmitted into hospital more often post discharge. Furthermore, they are at a higher
                    risk
                    of experiencing severe complications in subsequent pregnancies, like infection, uterine rupture and
                    haemorrhage.</p>

                    For the child, c-sections are associated with conditions like asthma and allergy in the short term,
                    and
                    obesity, high blood pressure and obesity later in life.</p>

                <p>
                    There is a less obvious, but equally compelling incentive to perform a c-section: financial
                    gain.</p><p>
                        Caesarean sections can be lucrative for a hospital. The Italian healthcare funding is
                        tariff-based:
                        providers are paid a fixed amount for each procedure they perform based on diagnosis-related
                        groups
                        (DRGs). The more complex a procedure and the hospital stay, the higher the refund to the
                        hospital.

                        In 2013, <a href='http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_914_listaFile_itemName0_file.pdf'
                            target='_blank'>a government investigation</a> revealed a number of hospitals submitted

                        medical
                        records, making it very difficult to verify if a c-section was medically justified. The analysis
                        concluded up to 43% of all c-sections performed could be unnecessary – that is, if they had been
                        performed at all. In Sicily, inspectors found an anomalous number of medical records where the

                        was
                        breech, which is a common reason to perform a c-section. The discharge forms, however, did not

                    <p>
                        “Pregnancy has become too medicalised. Women are being
                        pushed out of the picture,” doctor N. notes. It’s a complex question: should a doctor refuse a
                        woman’s
                        request for an unjustified surgery? Which is more important: a woman’s agency over her pregnancy
                        or
                        scientific evidence?</p>
                    <p>
                        However, how do women who opt for a c-section feel? Looking back upon it, Claudia isn’t so sure
                        of
                        her
                        choice.</p>
                    <p>“Recovery is really hard after a c-section," she explains. "And I was in so much pain during the
                        surgery as
                        well, it wasn’t like that the first time… You know what? In retrospect, I wish I’d done it
                        differently.
                        ‘Maybe I could have tried’, I tell myself.”</p>
                    <p>
                        And yet, a few months back, it wasn’t even an option.</p>
                    <p>“When you’ve already had a caesarean, doctors
                        tend
                        to be a lot more cautious with you," Claudia clarifies. "I chose a c-section because no other
                        option seemed viable.
                        Do
                        I even know any women who had a natural birth after a c-section? I don’t, really. It is almost a
                        default.”</p>
                    <p>
                        In some <a href='https://pne.agenas.it/' target='_blank'>northern hospitals</a>, as many as 50%
                        of
                        women with prior c-sections eventually have a vaginal
                        birth, versus 1 in 10 in the Mezzogiorno. The stark difference indicates that natural birth is
                        far
                        from
                        being standard in the South, with both doctors and patients reluctant to have trial labour.</p>
                    <p>
                        Even though it wasn’t medically justified, Claudia’s gynaecologist supported her decision.</p>
                    <p>“He was
                        also
                        a bit reluctant to let me have a ‘natural’ birth, so he didn’t push too much with that idea,"
                        Claudia explains. " I know
                        if I
                        had asked for it instead, he would have supported me regardless.”</p>
                    <p>And what if he hadn’t been on
                        board
                        with her c-section request? Claudia doesn't need to think about it.</p>
                    <p>“In that case, I would’ve probably looked for another doctor,” she
                        answers without hesitation.</p>

                        preferences. Numbers can't measure the trust relationship betweeen patients and their doctors,
                        but
                        it plays a large role in healthcare, especially during a pregnancy.
                    </p>
                    <p>"A gynaecologist isn't like any other doctor," Maria says. "They follow you from the first
                        appointment till the birth. It almost feels like they're pregnant with you."</p>
                    <p>"When you have a bad experience with a gynaecologist, it really affects you on a personal level",
                        Laura adds. "You really create an emotional bond with them. It doesn't happen as much with other
                        doctors."</p>
                    <p>
                        Claudia, Laura and Maria had very different experiences with pregnancies and c-sections. They
                        did
                        however, share one thing. All of them placed a great deal of trust in their gynaecologist: a
                        doctor,
                        but
                        also someone who gave them care, advice, and emotional support. Understanding the synergy
                        between patient and carer in this relationship is key to healthier and more safer pregnancies.

                        Gynaecologists are the first point of contact between a pregnant woman and the medical system.
                        Educating
                        and training practitioners helps both them and their patients realise that caesareans aren’t the
                        only
                        option – nor necessarily the safest one.</p>
                    <p>
                        A few hospitals in the Mezzogiorno are reversing the c-section trend, and more women now are
                        having a
                        vaginal birth. In Campania, some clinics have cut their c-section rate by 20% between 2016 and
                        2017.
                        Thanks to a mix of political will and pressure by the scientific community, hospitals are now
                        taking
                        steps to address malpractice.</p>

                        accordingly.</p>
                    <p>“There was a good synergy between national and regional strategic plans, consistently
                        endorsed by the local scientific experts,” Dr. De Vita explains. AOGOI and its sister
                        organisations
                        organised theoretical and practical training courses, including case studies with mannequins and

                        “By providing extensive training in smaller hospitals, we made them more secure," he adds. "That
                        way, they can
                        provide high-quality care, comply with regional and national standards, and resort to c-sections

                        the
                        official data (53.7%), which is still almost a 10-point reduction in 2 years.
                        If confirmed, these results could set an example for the rest of the
                        Mezzogiorno, where rates are still well above the 10-15% recommended by the WHO. Investing in
                        facilities, training and human resources would speed up progress, Dr. De Vita argues, but they
                        aren’t
                        always available. Seven regional healthcare systems (none of which are in the North) are
