                <p>Healthcare migration in Italy is a product of the historical and the current migration flows. Under
                    current laws, citizens can access most public services in a region even if they are not residents.
                    But in addition to this involuntary or accidental migration, there is also a voluntary one: people
                    and families travelling to another region for surgeries or other medical procedures.</p>
                <p>Given what we know about the disparities in the Italian healthcare system, this shouldn’t come as a
                    surprise. Patients visiting hospitals in the south report consistently lower satisfaction rates than
                    those hospitalised in the north.</p>
                <p>Given what we know about the disparities in the Italian healthcare system, this shouldn’t come as a
                    surprise. Patients visiting hospitals in the south report consistently lower satisfaction rates than
                    those hospitalised in the north. </p>
                <h2>Where do patients go?</h2>
                <p>The healthcare flows are modelled on the historical migration flows. Part of the movements occurs
                    within the same area: thus, we have a North-North, Centre-Centre and South-South flow. There is one
                    significant, but familiar outlier: a South-North healthcare flow. The opposite – North to South – is
                    practically non-existent.</p>
                <p>Part of these flows are fictitious. People can study and work in a region but keep their place of
                    residence elsewhere. And you can always end up in hospital while on holiday, as unfortunate as it
                    may be. This component might be significant but is impossible to measure. Additional studies,
                    however, have tried to isolate the voluntary component. According to a report by the Censis
                    institute, more than 1.5 million people migrated for health reasons in 2016. The number includes
                    around 950,000 patients and an estimated 825,000 people accompanying them. In most cases, the health
                    migrant will be with at least another person.</p>
                <p>In addition to same-area flows, 258,000 people moved from the South to the North; 235,000 from the
                    South to the centre; 180,000 from the Centre to the North. Overall, then, patients from the
                    Mezzogiorno account for over half of voluntary health migration flows.</p>
                <p>
                    Patients cite the quality of care and waiting lists as the main reasons to move. Cancer patients are
                    a majority (43%), followed by patients with heart conditions and chronic illnesses (26% and 24%
                    respectively).</p>
                <p>
                    When someone is faced with a life-threatening condition, or one that affects its ability to live a
                    full, complete life, finding timely and appropriate care becomes a priority. But it is difficult to
                    reconcile this need with average waiting times exceeding two months in the Centre and South of Italy
                    – half as much in the North.</p>
                <p>
                    Healthcare migration becomes less of a choice, and more of a necessity.
                </p>
                <h2>Necessity or privilege?</h2>
                <p>Healthcare migration is a cumbersome and stressful journey – but also a costly one. With transport,
                    board and lodging on top of prescriptions, examinations and check-ups, patients and those
                    accompanying them will have a hefty bill to pay. During all this time, the patient is presumably not
                    in work.</p>
                    <p>
                    Expenses can add up to €1,000 for cancer patients, on average – but it is probably a lot higher for
                    longer-term care and rehabilitation. In addition to that, if the patient goes into private care,
                    medical costs will be even higher. Between 2013 and 2015, admissions to public healthcare facilities
                    dropped by 3%, while those into private contracted facilities increased by 11%. What is more,
                    according to a 2014 study by CERGAS at the Bocconi university, healthcare migrants are more likely
                    to access private healthcare. While private and contracted facilities made up about a quarter of
                    resident admissions, they accounted for nearly half of long-distance migrants’ admissions.</p>
                    <p>
                    Not everyone can afford this journey. And it is easy to feel lost and discouraged, miles away from
                    home and with difficult days ahead. Some charities decided to step in and provide some assistance to
                    patients and their family. A roof over the heads at affordable prices or for free, logistical and psychological support. CasaAmica (“Friendly Home”) was
                    started in 1986 to assist patients travelling to Milan from all over the country. It now has four
                    hostels in Milan, one in the nearby city of Lecco, and one in Rome, and receives about 4,000
                    visitors per year. Three-quarters come from the Mezzogiorno.
