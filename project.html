            <div class="content">

                <p>
                    The story I chose to tell is a story everyone knows in Italy. Not only is it borne out by the data –
                    North-South disparities have existed for decades and generations of politicians have tried to
                    address them. It also becomes part of people’s identities and their views of the world around them.
                    The awareness of being at a disadvantage – of being poorer, backward, “less than” the wealthy
                    northerners – has accompanied me as well, growing up in the centre of Sardinia.</p>
                <p><strong>
                        If everyone knows about this gap, why write about it?</strong></p>
                <p>
                    First of all, “everyone knows” is not enough for me. To check if an assumption is true, you need to
                    investigate the facts and figures. Only then can you define the scope and scale of the inequality
                    problem.</p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, while economic figures may sound abstract, they have a tangible real-life impact. When we
                    focus on a country’s economy, we sometimes fail to make the connection between this dimension and
                    that of healthcare. In fact, an individual’s economic opportunities have a lot to do with
                    their standards of life, with their life expectancy and with the quality of healthcare they receive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, after realising we do, indeed, have an inequality problem, new questions should arise. How
                    is it that two regions in the same country have vastly different economic, social and healthcare
                    systems? Why does this problem exist? And what can we do to solve it?</p>
                <p>
                    This project is for my family members or acquaintances, who countless times, when I
                    complained about injustice, told me “I know, but it will never change.” The people I interviewed
                    often expressed the same frustration.</p>
                <p>
                    The sense of hopelessness, the acceptance of inequality and injustice prompted me to undertake
                    this
                    project and encouraged me along the way. The key point I want to make is this:
                    inequality
                    isn’t a fate befallen on some and not others. While living conditions have vastly improved for
                    everyone
                    since the 19th century, there are still significant differences. </p>
                <p>Hence the title “A tale of two
                    countries”: a wealthier North with efficient public services, higher income and higher life
                    expectancy,
                    and a South rife with poverty, where people are more economically <em>and</em> physically
                    vulnerable, tend to
                    get
                    sick and die more often. Crucially, these two countries exist within the same political, social and
                    administrative system – which is why these differences are not justifiable, nor are they acceptable.
