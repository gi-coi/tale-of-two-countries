            <div class="content">

                    <p>
                            The story I chose to tell is a story everyone knows in Italy. Not only is it borne out by the data:
                            North-South disparities have existed for decades, and generations of politicians have tried to
                            address
                            them. It also becomes part of people’s identities and their views of the world around them. The
                            awareness of being at a disadvantage – of being poorer, backward, “less than” the wealthy
                            northerners –
                            has accompanied me as well, growing up in the centre of Sardinia.</p>
                        <p><strong>
                                If everyone knows about this gap, what’s the use in writing about it?</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            Firstly, “everyone knows” is not enough for me. I wanted to define the scope and scale of the
                            inequality
                            problem, check this assumption against facts and figures.</p>
                        <p>
                            Secondly, when we focus on a country’s economy, we sometimes fail to make the connection between
                            this
                            dimension and that of healthcare. In fact, an individual’s economic opportunities are intuitively
                            connected with their standards of life, with their life expectancy and with the quality of
                            healthcare
                            they receive. Economic figures may sound abstract, but they have a tangible real-life impact.</p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, after realising we do, indeed, have an inequality problem, new questions should arise. How
                            is
                            it that two regions in the same country have vastly different economic, social and healthcare
                            systems?
                            Why does this problem exist? And what can we do to solve it?</p>
                            <p>
        
                        I imagined this project having in mind my family members or acquaintances, who countless times, when I
                        complained about injustice, told me “I know, but it will never change.” The people I interviewed often
                        expressed the same frustration.</p>
                        <p>
                        Their sense of hopelessness, the acceptance of inequality and injustice prompted me to undertake this
                        project and encouraged me along the way. The most important point in my work is to prove that inequality
                        isn’t a fate befallen on some and not others. While living conditions have vastly improved for everyone
                        since the 19th century, there are still unacceptable differences. </p>
                        <p>Hence the title “A tale of two
                        countries”: a wealthier North with efficient public services, higher income and higher life expectancy,
                        and a South rife with poverty, where people are more economically and physically vulnerable, tend to get
                        sick and die more often. Crucially, these two countries exist within the same political, social and
                        administrative system – which is why these differences are not justifiable, nor are they acceptable.</p>
