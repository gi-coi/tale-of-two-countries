            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Ottana is a remote hamlet in the heart of Sardinia. At first glance, it looks just like any other
                    village
                    in the area: a few houses built around a main road and a central square, small shops, café bars with
                    tables outside, a medieval church. But driving there from the highway, these aren’t the first thing
                    you
                    see. Two tall chimneys, stranded in the yellow plain, dominate Ottana’s unusual skyline. They are a
                    reminder of the town’s industrial past, and of its painful present.</p>
                <p>
                    Luigi was born in 1950 in Orani, another tiny village twenty minutes from Ottana. By 1973
                    he had moved to Turin for work, but saw an unusual opportunity back home. He applied for a job as an
                    analyst at Enichem, a chemical company based in Ottana. It was a great opportunity: the job was
                    prestigious, it was close to home, and the pay was good. He worked there for forty years, until the
                    plant ceased production in 2003.</p>
                <p>
                    Luigi would retire 5 years later in 2008, ready to settle down. He could finally spend his days with
                    his
                    family and do the things he loved, like fishing with his sons. “He wasn’t used to sitting around,”
                    his
                    wife, Gina, remembers. “He liked being outside, going places. When he retired, I told him, ‘Go out,
                    do
                    whatever you want, enjoy it!’.</p>
                <p>
                    But it wasn’t meant to be. In 2011 Luigi began complaining about a pain in his chest. For a smoker
                    like
                    him, coughing wasn’t unusual, but this time it felt different. At first, Luigi brushed it off, took
                    some
                    painkillers, did some inhalations. His GP advised tests, but the man was stubborn. It would take a
                    lot
                    of convincing before he went to the hospital.</p>
                <p>
                    “Dispiachiu”, that’s how he felt when he came back home. In Sardinian, the word is emotionally
                    charged.
                    It means sad, sorry, apologetic. Luigi was sorry to disrupt his family’s happiness. Sorry to cause
                    his
                    wife, Gina, so much pain. And sad, because deep down inside, he’d always known this would happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “He was scared of going to the hospital because he knew they’d find something. He knew something was
                    off
                    at that plant.”, says Gina. That job had been all his life; in the end, it became his death, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luigi died from cancer one year later. At least 200 workers and former workers at the Ottana
                    factories
                    have suffered the same fate. Their families are now fighting a legal battle to receive
                    compensation.<br>
                    “You know, this factory was a big deal for all of us. They brought jobs, hundreds of them.” Gina
                    sighs.
                    “But they also brought death.”</p>

                <h2>"When they came, people hailed them as a blessing"</h2>

                <p>

                    Ottana’s industrial dream began in the early 1970s, poverty was rife in the area. Sardinia was known
                    to
                    outsiders as a backwater, full of bandits and violent crime.</p>
                <p>
                    The government saw rapid industrialisation as a solution to the island’s systemic economic and
                    social
                    problems. By generating jobs and economic turnover for the whole area, it was argued, many of
                    Sardinia’s
                    ills, including banditry and crime, would be cured. Industrialisation was the antidote to a toxic,
                    anachronistic and backward culture. It was time to uproot a system that only produced poverty and
                    widespread violence.</p>
                <p>
                    With the “Piano di rinascita” (Rebirth plan), the government covered the costs of basic
                    infrastructure,
                    while, state-owned corporations like ENI implemented the industrial strategy.</p>
                <p>
                    The initiative promised to create at least 14,000 jobs, bringing prosperity and progress to the
                    remote
                    region. With the prospect of economic prosperity came hope that Sardinia could finally reach its
                    potential. “When they came, people hailed them like a blessing.” Piera, 65, was married to Quirico
                    Ferreri, an analyst at Enichem who died from lung cancer in 2016. <br>“They’d promised an airport,
                    you know,
                    a railway, but they didn’t do any of these things. I wish they’d built an airport and then left; we
                    would be better off now.” When the first factories opened in 1973, dozens of farmers sold their
                    cattle
                    and their land in exchange for a secure job and a fixed salary. Many others left their previous jobs
                    in
                    the mainland to work there like Luigi.</p>
                <p>
                    The march for economic and social progress was stumbling by the end of the decade, when the first
                    domino
                    fell. Metallurgica del Tirso, a metallurgical factory folded, leaving 450 workers out of work. The
                    biggest employer, Enichem – a petrochemical company, and part of the ENI group – held on until the
                    early
                    2000s. Enichem employed 2,800 people in the early 1980s; only 510 – 200 of whom were being made
                    redundant – in 2000. By 2003 Enichem had shut down all operations in Sardinia.</p>
                <p>
                    The 1990s: that’s is when the first phase of privatisations began. Local newspapers call it the age
                    of
                    the “spezzatino”. Much like a delicious dish, Enichem split up and sold off its facilities and
                    machinery. The Italian government contributed almost €200 million to attract new sponsors.
                    Twenty-nine
                    companies answered the call: many of them from overseas, such as U.S. owned Dow Chemical, and Saudi
                    PIC.</p>
                <p>
                    Most of them would leave as soon as the money ran dry, taking hundreds of jobs away with them.
                    There
                    are now 69 [trova quante imprese ci sono adesso, quante attive] … Nice.</p>

                <h2>The cathedral in the desert</h2>
                <p>
                    The story of Ottana is common amongst other villages and towns in the Mezzogiorno: a superficial
                    blast
                    of public money to build factories in the middle of nowhere, only to collapse under the weight of
                    their
                    own unsustainability. In Italian, they’re called “cattedrali nel deserto”, or “cathedrals in the
                    desert”: ambitious projects with no integrated network of demand around them. The prospect of
                    developing these sites to viability is low. Transport and energy costs are high, raw materials need
                    to
                    be shipped from the mainland, roads are in bad shape. In the case of Ottana, the “desert” is a
                    literal
                    one.</p>
                <p>
                    From the highway the industrial area of Ottana sits in front of the town. The closed factories give
                    the
                    impression of a burgeoning industry, but there are no trucks on the roads. The industrial park
                    straddles
                    three municipalities – Ottana, Bolotana, and Noragugume – home to no more than 6,000 people. The
                    park is
                    a labyrinthian collection of dusty roads leading to landfills and abandoned factories.<br>Many of
                    them were
                    left derelict for so long they now at risk of collapse. Enichem was the largest plant in the area
                    and
                    owned most of the site. The gates of the main plant are closed, now. They, too, have almost become a
                    symbol. Workers, citizens, trade unions stage demonstrations there. Across the gates hung a banner –
                    “Politicians are jackals”.</p>
                <p>
                    A helmet lies abandoned near the empty parking lot. A dingy discoloured sign points to a cavernous
                    abandoned canteen. Hundreds of workers used to gather daily for a bite and a chat with their
                    colleagues.
                    In a day of a vicious heat, with temperatures exceeding 40° C, the sense of hopelessness and despair
                    is
                    palpable.</p>
                <p>
                    The real tragic legacy of “The Rebirth Plan” stretches far beyond the story of poorly conceived
                    industrial projects. It is also one of labour law violations, injustice, and death. For more than
                    thirty
                    years, workers were unknowingly and consistently exposed to a wide range of toxic substances on a
                    daily
                    basis. One of these was asbestos – a deadly carcinogen. Workers had few or no protections and were
                    never
                    informed of the risks. They were reassured with regular medical check-ups at the factory, no reason
                    to
                    worry, or so they thought.</p>
                <p>
                    In the 1990s some workers had begun to develop rare and aggressive forms of cancer. By the early
                    2000s
                    enough cases had accumulated to raise suspicions about the veracity of the safety measures taken by
                    the
                    companies. It would be the start of a long legal battle.</p>

                <h2>More than 1,000 compensation claims rejected</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2003 Gianpaolo was sent to the hospital with excruciating back pain. Like Luigi, he had worked at
                    Enichem since the factory opened in the early 1970s. Gianpaolo had a critical role at the factory -
                    he
                    cleaned the machinery and sewage wells. In 2004, the occupational physician diagnosed him with
                    chemical
                    poisoning caused at least in part by the workplace and advised he should leave his job as soon as
                    possible. Before Gianpaolo could take some time off, the factory shut down - he and his colleagues
                    were
                    fired.</p>
                <p>
                    Around the same time, both he and Luigi applied for compensation for the chemical and asbestos
                    exposure
                    in the workplace. INAIL – the state insurance provider – would reject their claims in 2006.</p>
                <p>
                    The dye, however, was cast. In 2011, doctors found a tumour in Luigi’s lungs. He died in 2012, at 62
                    years old. One year later, Gianpaolo was diagnosed with throat cancer. His struggle lasted almost
                    two
                    years. He, too, was 62 when he died in 2014.</p>
                <p>
                    According to the insurance provider, asbestos hadn’t killed them. INAIL based its decisions on a
                    2003
                    report, which acknowledged the presence of asbestos, but stated it was below the threshold required
                    to
                    grant pension benefits to former workers.<br>“The plant was inspected after some of the material had
                    already been removed. INAIL maintained the factory didn’t make asbestos, which is true, but it was
                    everywhere at the plant” points out Giovannino Marteddu. He worked as a contractor at Enichem from
                    1974
                    to 1990 and today he’s the mayor of Orotelli, a nearby village. His company worked directly with
                    asbestos fibres.</p>
                <p>
                    Of 1,081 requests for benefits made up to 2017, 1,066 were rejected on these grounds. Even when
                    workers
                    developed mesothelioma – which is directly correlated to asbestos exposure –, the insurance
                    provider,
                    while granting compensation for these cases, kept denying there were dangers at the factory. The
                    wall of
                    rejections and bureaucracy didn’t stop workers and their families. Requests piled up, and new cases
                    came
                    to light.</p>
                <h2>
                    “We didn’t know any better, but we were all complicit”: daily life at the plant</h2>
                <p>
                    The industrial zone of Ottana had been a blessing for a deprived, malaria-stricken area. “They had
                    made
                    so many promises, and of course we welcomed them here. People needed those jobs.”, explains Gianni
                    (not
                    his real name), a local resident. Everyone talks about “them”, the faceless, nameless employers.
                    Under
                    several names, it was always the same company – ENI, the state-controlled oil and gas giant. As
                    industry
                    leader, Enichem had significant leverage: jobs, hundreds of jobs. Short-lived superficial glimmers
                    of
                    hope – but all that glitters isn’t gold.</p>
                <p>
                    Slowly but surely, the plant slowly ate the workers away. “I’ve seen Luigi change in those thirty
                    years.
                    When he began work, he was fine. But years went by, and he felt worse and worse… That cough never
                    went
                    away. That job drained him. And then it killed him.”, says Gina.</p>
                <p>
                    Just like Gina, the community began to develop a sense something was happening to them. They grew to
                    realise that the factory, and everything around it, was potentially smothered in poisonous
                    chemicals.
                    Obfuscated records make it difficult to investigate conditions during those years at the plant.
                    Serious
                    doubts have been raised as to whether toxic waste was disposed of correctly, in the absence of
                    supporting documents. Sometimes, workers were allowed to take home discarded objects. “They received
                    these blue plastic containers, airtight lid and all. I know people who fermented wine in those
                    barrels!
                    Wine! God knows what had been in there before. We didn’t know any better… But I think in the end, we
                    were all complicit. We should have known. We didn’t ask enough questions.”</p>
                <p>
                    The two main disposal routes were air and water, as confirmed by the mayor of Ottana. Sewage waters
                    and
                    liquid waste ended up in the Tirso river and made their way to the lake Omodeo, the largest
                    artificial
                    basin in Europe. The chimneys emitted polluting dusts that contaminated the air for miles.</p>
                <p>
                    Several workers recalled large holes in the ground, where management dumped toxic waste and empty
                    barrels, before covering everything with a plastic tarp before burying it. These claims haven’t been
                    proven in subsequent inspections, but health authorities have cordoned off a small area that had
                    been
                    used as an illegal landfill. This area is still owned by Enichem – now called Syndial – and it’s
                    still
                    contaminated. It’s impossible to investigate the extent of the contamination without risking further
                    poisoning of the soil or groundwater.</p>
                <h3>
                    “There is dust everywhere”</h3>
                <p>
                    “Every year, they organised a Christmas lunch for workers and the families. We all went – my
                    husband,
                    our children and I went there every year. When I got off the car, this foul smell hit me
                    immediately. It
                    didn’t have a specific source, it was everywhere. I couldn’t wait to be inside just so I could
                    escape
                    that awful smell.” Gina shudders remembering all the times her husband warned about the dangers at
                    the
                    plant.</p>
                <p>
                    “There was a cherry tree near the factory, but no one ever picked the fruits off of it. And when he
                    went
                    fishing with our sons, they never brought the fish home to cook them.”</p>
                <p>
                    “I remember when Luigi brought home his coveralls. I took them outside and shook them off before
                    washing
                    them. ‘They’re so dusty’, I told Luigi. He answered, ‘You should see it at the plant. There is dust
                    everywhere. On our hands and faces, on the floor, floating in the air… It’s everywhere.” That dust
                    was
                    asbestos. There was no real separation between departments. The dust floated through the grids and
                    the
                    aeration units, reaching every corner of the plant.</p>
                <p>
                    In addition to this, pieces of safety equipment, like gloves, suits and jackets, were made of
                    asbestos.
                    Workers used them because they were heat-resistant. In many cases, workers worked with hazardous
                    substances without the required protective clothing.<br>Luigi handled asbestos sheets with a cutter
                    and his
                    hands. Gianpaolo cleaned sewage with nothing but a paper mask covering his nose and mouth. Once, he
                    fell
                    into a well he was cleaning and spent three hours down there before he was eventually rescued. No
                    matter
                    how much he scrubbed, the smell of the sludge persisted for more than a month. Another time, a pipe
                    blew
                    up and he got third-degree burns on his chest.</p>

                <h3>A broken promise</h3>
                <p>
                    “I had just turned 18 when I was hired,” says Giovannino Marteddu. “I was overjoyed when I received
                    my
                    first paycheck. I was young and inexperienced, of course I didn’t take any precautions. None of us
                    did.
                    We handled asbestos fibres with our bare hands, coated and uncoated the pipes, changed the gaskets…
                    I
                    worked for a contractor, so I knew all the units as the back of my hand. I saw the motes floating in
                    the
                    air, through the light. The worst unit was the lab, because it was smaller and secluded. You’d think
                    larger rooms would be more dangerous because there is more dust, but that’s not the case. In the
                    lab,
                    the air was thicker, the dust was more concentrated. That’s why so many people died there.” </p>
                <p>The lab –
                    unit AT05 – is where Quirico, Luigi and Gianpaolo worked. Their supervisor, Giovannino Moro, died
                    from
                    mesothelioma in the early 2000s. Of the 32 analysts working there, 18 have died, and most of the
                    survivors are sick.</p>
                <p>
                    “What is Enichem? For hundreds of people, it was a broken promise,” says Ms. Sabina Contu, regional
                    president of AIEA (Associazione Italiana Esposti Amianto), an NGO that advocates for people who have
                    been exposed to asbestos. “The factory gave a lot to this area. It gave jobs, yes, but it also
                    formed a
                    mindset. It created a work culture. For the workers, it became life, and a way to support their
                    families. Sadly, no one ever protected them from the side effects of these industrial activities.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enichem was the promise of steady income for a land that was starved for industrial progress. It
                    made
                    tens of people able to afford a home and a comfortable life they could never have accessed
                    otherwise.
                    Entire new neighbourhoods were born out of this newfound, albeit fleeting, prosperity. But many more
                    of
                    Enichem’s promises failed to materialise. It’s tempting to think what could have been Sardinia were
                    to
                    become a thriving industrial economy. However, would that have changed anything for factory workers.
                    Would they have been protected, if the company had made more money?</p>
                <p>
                    Several workers remember the day when “the Americans” came to visit the plants. “The wore masks and
                    white coveralls. They looked like astronauts,” says Giovannino. “We laughed at them, why would they
                    be
                    wearing masks? There was nothing to worry about. Obviously, they knew something we didn’t.” But even
                    when workers knew or sensed something was wrong, they didn’t speak up for fear of losing their jobs.
                    Trade union representatives never raised the issue of pollution and the health hazards for workers,
                    at
                    least publicly. They are now working with AIEA, but their responsibilities in covering up, or
                    ignoring,
                    the dangers at Enichem are unknown.</p>
                <p>
                    Progress came at a hefty price for factory workers at Enichem and elsewhere. But the fact Enichem
                    was a
                    state-owned company makes the betrayal more painful, according to Franco Saba, Ottana’s mayor.
                    “Enichem
                    shouldn’t have left. When they sold the plants off and fled… it’s the government that left us. The
                    government abandoned us, even though we’re poor, even though the economy has gone back to the 1960s.
                    And
                    they didn’t even clean up after themselves.”</p>
                <p>
                    Enichem had ceased all operations in Sardinia in 2014, after selling its last facilities. It did not
                    complete the decontamination plan, leaving the local administration to deal with the fallout. Other
                    companies that came after Enichem followed its disastrous footsteps.<br>Mr. Paolo Clivati, owner of
                    Ottana
                    Energia – a thermal power plant, now closed – is under trial for polluting the river and was fined
                    for
                    carrying out unauthorised operations at the factory. On the night of the 14th October 2013, an
                    experiment with liquid coal, called Cwf, led to an explosion generating an ominous dark dust cloud.
                    The
                    next morning, farmers in the nearby villages found their sheep and their pastures had turned black.

                <h2>The workers’ fight for healthcare</h2>
                <p>
                    Having been
                    exposed to asbestos, chemicals and radiations for years, workers should have had special attention
                    and regular specialised check-ups. Instead, their professional risk was not recognised, unlike
                    workers at other factories in Sardinia and the rest of the country. By the time the recognition
                    status and compensation arrived, it was much too late for many.</p>
                <p>

                    At other ENI factories working in the same sector and with the same materials, the presence of
                    asbestos had been ascertained. When the government had investigated <a
                        href='http://www.associazioneitalianaespostiamianto.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AIEA-prot.13_2017_stampa.pdf'
                        target='_blank'>another one of ENI’s plants</a> – in
                    Pisticci, Basilicata – the chemical giant had been more cooperative. The company had provided
                    documents detailing the use of asbestos at the plant, which led 450 workers to receive disability
                    benefits in 2005. At least 580 more cases were successfully contested by workers in court.</p>
                <p>Pisticci
                    and Ottana were twin plants. They were opened a couple of years apart – Pisticci in 1972, Ottana in
                    1974; both had a roughly similar structure, and both produced synthetic fibres. Ottana was to
                    complement and expand Pisticci’s production. However, their safety records were inexplicably treated
                    differently by the government and the national insurance provider.<br>ENI’s ambiguous role carried a
                    huge weight in this decision. The company consistently denied the presence of asbestos in Ottana,
                    insisting the two plants were unrelated, despite factual evidence pointing to the contrary.
                    Eyewitnesses, internal documents and subsequent inspections prove conclusively asbestos was widely
                    present, and the company’s statements were inaccurate.</p>
                <p>The two plants may be twins, but they endured
                    two different fates: in the case of Ottana, workers ran into a bureaucratic mire. The regional
                    insurance provider rejected most of their claims for compensation. Some of them were unaware their
                    health had ever been jeopardised.</p>
                <p>“I left the job in 1990 and entered politics,” recalls Giovannino,
                    Orotelli’s mayor. “I didn’t think too much of it afterwards, until the early 2000s, when a former
                    colleague asked me if I had applied for the occupational pension. ‘For what?’, I asked. ‘For what?
                    For asbestos!’, he replied. I had no idea it was something I was supposed to do. I rushed to the
                    office in Nuoro [the province capital] and applied. Luckily, I did, because that left a paper trail
                    which later strengthened my case. But that was the first time I heard of it.”</p>
                <p>Giovannino’s
                    experience shows how employees were often kept in the dark about their safety in the workplace.
                    Public awareness on the dangers of asbestos was very low, and even though the production and sale of
                    the material had been banned since 1992. It took the Sardinian government thirteen years to
                    translate the national provisions into regional law. In 2007, the regional government published the
                    first asbestos abatement plan, which is still far from completion.</p>
                <p>The belief that all was well in
                    Ottana remained unshaken for years, even when increasing numbers of former employees reported
                    serious health problems. Their concerns often went unaddressed and their complaints were belittled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Angela believes her husband’s case didn’t receive enough attention. “He was killed twice. First at
                    the factory, then in the hospital.” Gianpaolo had surgery and was told he was cancer free for
                    months. A year later, he’d find out that the tumour had metastasised, it was too late to save him.
                    “They told us he’d beat cancer. Everyone knew he had been exposed to chemicals, but they only
                    focused on his throat, they didn’t look elsewhere. Every symptom he had was quickly dismissed. He
                    was shuffled between hospitals for months. He had surgery, biopsies, and tests. Why did this
                    happen?”</p>
                <p>Giovannino’s struggle with medicine and bureaucracy lasted for years. His diagnosis shook
                    him deeply. “When you receive the news… I can’t explain how you feel. I felt as if all the blood had
                    been drained from my body. Then life goes on, you learn to manage it, but still… once you have it,
                    it never leaves. It can only get worse with time. And it does get worse. You can’t help it, just
                    slow it down.” The insurance provider rejected his initial chest x-rays because he’d made them at a
                    local private hospital. Even when the doctors proved his condition was asbestos-related, INAIL
                    rejected his application. The legal back and forth which lasted three years, before the institute
                    finally recognised Giovannino was entitled to rights.</p>
                <p>Believe it or not, Giovannino is one of the
                    lucky ones. Thanks to a regional health surveillance programme, he now receives free check-ups every
                    year, as well as counselling to help him manage his condition. Many didn’t have the same luck. This
                    system was established in 2010 to monitor people who had been exposed to asbestos in the workplace.
                    1,170 people had applied by 2015, but Ottana workers weren’t among them. Their claims weren’t even
                    considered, their work was not considered an occupational hazard. The regional health provider
                    eventually relented in 2016 and the workers of Ottana are now considered part of the scheme. More
                    than ____ former workers are currently enrolled in this programme.</p>
<p>
                What difference does it make? “It is a crucial safeguard,” says Ms. Sabina Contu, AIEA’s president. AIEA
                lobbied heavily to achieve this result. “These tests can save lives. They improve life expectancy and
                prevention outcomes. If someone develops cancer, they can catch it early and immediately begin
                treatment. Truth be told, it is not a cure-all. The damage can’t be undone. Some people can gain a few
                years, nothing more. But even then, their living standards improve. That’s why it became my first goal
                three years ago, when my organisation began working on this case in earnest.”</p>
                <h2>Enter AIEA: Ottana takes centre stage</h2>
                <p>
                With AIEA’s contribution, the case of Ottana has gained notoriety. The story, which had
                received minimal media coverage in the past, found its way into mainstream political debate. In November
                2015, a complaint filed by AIEA prompted a criminal investigation on the matter. The police seized the
                whole industrial district for further investigation, as well as documents and reports. ARPAS, the
                regional environment protection agency, inspected the site and flagged 18 areas that either contained
                asbestos or needed further investigation.</p>
                <p>
                AIEA also lobbied the regional and national parliaments to address the issue. In January 2017, widows of
                former Enichem workers travelled to Rome with the mayors of three neighbouring villages: Ottana, Orani
                and Orotelli. They met the speaker of the lower house of Parliament, Ms. Laura Boldrini, who took the
                case to heart. A special parliamentary commission set out to investigate workplace security and health
                hazards at several industrial sites in Sardinia – including Ottana was called. Finally, a breakthrough.
                It wasn’t much, but it raised hopes.</p>
                <p>
                Based on the evidence submitted by families and organisations, the commission concluded former workers
                had been exposed to asbestos and were therefore entitled to inability pensions. INAIL had been wrong all
                along: asbestos was there, and it was killing people.</p>
                <p>
                In mid-2018 two commissions were set up by the regional assembly: one to investigate the economic and
                environmental disaster in Ottana, and one to examine the presence of asbestos in Sardinia. In the wake
                of these political movements, INAIL finally recognised asbestos exposure in late 2018. The cases for
                compensations are scheduled to conclude by the end of 2019.</p>
                <p>
                “I’m a very hands-on kind of person. I set the goals for this case and we’re getting there. I wanted the
                health surveillance, and we got that. I wanted the victims and their relatives to receive benefits, and
                we’re getting there. I fought for compensation, and that is coming as well. We didn’t try to barter our
                way through it, we just resorted to the law and the scientific evidence available. When an office
                bureaucrat is confronted with the law, there isn’t much they can’t do. And if they don’t agree, a judge
                in court will.” A rigorous case, according to Ms. Contu, is the secret behind the successful political
                and legal battle.</p>

                AIEA estimates more than 200 Ottana employees have died from asbestos-related diseases since the 1990s.
                What is worse, casualties are expected to peak in the next five years. The figure, of course, doesn’t
                include all the workers who may have developed other conditions. After all, they were exposed to several
                carcinogens and radiations, with minimal controls. “The possible downside – let’s call it that way – of
                our rigorous approach, is some of the workers will never get compensation, because there is no
                conclusive scientific evidence yet. I came across a few rare diseases, which are most likely linked to
                the work environment, but we can’t make a strong case. They’re also victims of this system.”</p>

                <h2>What is left behind</h2>
                <p>
                Very little is known about the long-term impacts of industrial activity on the residents in the area.
                It’s almost impossible to establish how many people suffered from chemical exposure to asbestos or other
                hazardous chemicals. One study on a cement asbestos plan in Apulia estimated people who were exposed to
                asbestos outside of work (including family members) were twice as likely to develop asbestos-related
                diseases. In Ottana, the water from the river was used in farming and agriculture, the fine dust
                pollution spread for miles. Multiple studies carried out in recent years found the groundwater at
                several sites is still heavily polluted with numerous carcinogens.</p>
                <p>
                Studies on residents offered contradicting conclusions. The incidence of lung cancer appears to be above
                average, according to research presented in 2015. A regional cancer database could offer a clearer
                picture, but the project, which started in 2016, hasn’t been concluded. A recent parliamentary
                inspection, however, has raised alarm on the state of the plant. The regional environmental agency
                disputed these claims, maintaining actual contamination levels were lower.</p>
                

                <h2>Ottana’s future: moving away from toxic industries</h2>
                <p>
                Years of industrial activity have left their mark on Ottana. For better or for worse, they have turned
                the rural village into the industrial community it is today. “Someone who didn’t grow up here might look at those huge
                chimneys and see death. For us, there is more to it than that. Those two towers have become a symbol –
                of death, yes, but also prosperity, jobs, a better life for our children. For a long time, when we had
                to choose between health and jobs, we chose the jobs. Now, that choice is unacceptable. I don’t want to
                make the same mistake. What happened in the last forty years cannot happen again.”</p>
                <p>
                The collapse of the industrial dream has left the local economy in shambles and attracting new investors
                is proving difficult to reconcile with the need to protect citizens and restore the environment. Being
                an industrial town again isn’t impossible, but administrators need to be cautious.</p>
                <p>
                Mr. Saba was elected mayor in 2015 on an environmental-friendly platform. The previous administration –
                of which he was deputy mayor – fought against plans to convert a closed thermal power plant to a coal
                plant, endorsed by the regional government. “The project… is a step back, a decision that damages us and
                was made without involving us,” then-mayor Mr. Gian Paolo Marras had <a href='http://www.lanuovasardegna.it/nuoro/cronaca/2013/06/26/news/carbone-a-ottana-il-sindaco-marras-respinge-il-progetto-1.7326585' target='_blank'>declared</a> in 2013.</p>
                <p>Documents of one
                of the meetings between the local administrations, members of the national and regional governments,
                trade unions and Confindustria – the national employment federation – reveal Ottana’s mayor was under
                significant pressure. The deputy minister for economic development, for example, deplored the mayor’s
                opposition to the coal plant, which “will jeopardise the future of the company and of the workers.” Coal
                for jobs: that was the bargain. A deal Mr. Marras rejected, and so did citizen groups and the
                <a href='https://ricerca.gelocal.it/lanuovasardegna/archivio/lanuovasardegna/2013/09/29/NZ_40_03.html' target='_blank'>neighbouring administrations</a>. The plan was eventually shelved.</p>
                
                
                
                
                Just like his predecessor, Mr. Saba thinks local politics should draw the line for private companies. He
                also issued an <a href='https://www.cagliaripad.it/376003/ottana-il-sindaco-saba-il-comune-non-ha-i-mezzi-per-la-bonifica' target='_blank'>administrative ordinance</a>, forcing companies in industrial sites to reclaim the areas
                they’ve previously occupied. “I won’t waste taxpayers’ money to pay for something the private sector
                should have dealt with. They come and go, never respect their obligations.”
                The fight to reclaim Ottana’s industrial area has been, and still is, an uphill battle against business
                and bureaucracy. The Italian national government refused an application to classify Ottana as a Site of
                National Interest (SIN) for land reclamation. This status would have placed the Ministry of Environment
                directly in charge of the clean-up procedure. The Enichem site wasn’t large enough and did not
                employ enough workers to qualify. This means the regional government take charge of clean-up operations,
                but progress has been slow and funding inconsistent. This hasn’t stopped Mr. Saba.
                “We keep lobbying with the regional government, we’re going to meetings and we’ve set our priorities. We
                want to complete the reclamation, then we want to move forward. Attract new investors to the area,
                entrepreneurs who provide jobs, abide by laws and respect the environment. If I run for elections again
                and I am elected, I will even go to the EU Court of Justice if necessary.”
                As for asbestos, most of it has been removed, according to the mayor and a report by the regional
                environmental agency. This battle is coming to an end, but the war isn’t over, warns Ms. Sabina Contu.
                “There’s still a lot of work to do, and we need to stay focused” explains AIEA’s president. Generous
                payments and heartfelt promises alone will not undo all the damage caused by decades of uncontrolled
                industrialisation. She fears the movement for justice might lose momentum, now that AIEA has achieved
                most of its goals.
                “We’ve had to pick our battles. We dealt with asbestos, but we haven’t taken up the issue of
                <a href='https://www.cronachenuoresi.it/2019/02/18/ottana-9mila-tonnellate-di-ceneri-di-rifiuti-tossici-in-un-terreno-agricolo-il-deputato-manca-sporge-denuncia/' target='_blank'>environmental damage</a> as a whole, for example. We’ve felt isolated in this struggle. Others should join
                us and move forward with these issues.” Politicians, organisations and citizens need to remain vigilant
                to make sure this tragedy won’t happen again.
                “This is a story of economic, social, medical inequality. The damage has been done, and now the time has
                come to fix it. But inequality can serve a purpose: it can push us to act. When we’re aware of what’s
                happening, and we decide to act upon it – to enforce and defend our rights – then we will truly move
                forward. That is progress.”
