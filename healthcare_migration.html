            </div>

            <div class="content">

                <p>

                    Luca (not his real name) is a 10-year-old boy who lives in southern Italy. One day, his joints
                    started to hurt, and before long he was unable to move. Diagnosing him was not straightforward, his
                    doctor explains. “First of all, I ordered an x-ray. The nearest hospital turned him away, because
                    the waiting lists were too long. It’s <a href='https://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/05266l.htm'
                        target='_blank'>illegal</a>, but when you’re the patient there isn’t much you can
                    do.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luca would wait a month before finally getting x-rays at a hospital 150 kilometres away from his
                    home. For a whole month Luca was on painkillers - his arms hurt so much he could barely move them.
                    As a result of the X-ray doctors diagnosed he needed surgery but, there was another problem. “The
                    doctors at that hospital refused to operate on him… they wouldn’t even say why. Apparently, no
                    hospital in the region could treat him.”</p>
                <p>
                    They advised Luca travel to a hospital in the North-West of Italy. His mother immediately booked the
                    plane tickets. Luca would be admitted there, but doctors requested new scans. Luca’s family was told
                    the ones they already had were faulty. After repeating the x-rays, he was finally sent to surgery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Luca is recovering, luckily he already feels a lot better; but it took two months, three different
                    hospitals, two sets of x-rays and a 600-kilometre trip to across the country to receive treatment.
                    “It’s disheartening,” his doctor comments. “This boy was in constant pain, and yet he couldn’t get
                    the help he needed. He was caught up in a net of inefficiency and time-consuming bureaucracy. It’s
                    unacceptable.”</p>
                <p>
                    Luca is one of about 500,000 patients who each year travel from the Mezzogiorno to the rest of the
                    country to receive medical treatment. They are healthcare migrants: residents compelled to use
                    healthcare services in a different region.</p>

                <h2>Low quality and mistrust are the biggest 'push' factors</h2>
                <p>
                    Healthcare migration in Italy is partly the product of the historical migration flows, but it
                    evolved into a separate phenomenon.

                   <p> 
                    Italy is now known as an immigration hub, but this was not always the case. In the early 20th
                    century, Italy was a land of emigration, and in many ways, it still is.</p>
                    <p>What became known as the
                    “Italian diaspora” emerged shortly after unification. Between 1876 and 1914, almost 14 million
                    people, mostly from the North-east, moved to continental Europe. By 1913, Southern Italy had
                    overtaken and accounted for 47 percent of outflows. Most emigration from the Mezzogiorno, however,
                    was transatlantic – mostly North and South America and Australia.</p>
                    <p>At this stage, migrants tended to
                    be men, young and low-skilled leaving the country to find better economic conditions. Most emigrants
                    were initially employed in mining and construction and would eventually be joined by high-skilled
                    workers, often with their families.</p>
                    <p>
                    The post-World War 2 economic expansion prompted a fresh wave of internal migration. Between 1952
                    and 1970, the average income per capita grew 130%. The North benefited the most from this
                    accelerated growth, with the Mezzogiorno pegging behind.</p>
                    <p>At least 9 million people moved from the
                    South to the North of Italy during this time, chasing the promise of the “economic miracle”. Many
                    immigrated illegally, due to a fascist-era anti-urbanisation law abolished in 1961.</p>
                    <p>Far from
                    stemming migration, this law only made it covert. Entire families left the Mezzogiorno and settled
                    in the industrial North – especially the so-called Industrial Triangle area between Turin, Milan and
                    Genoa.</p>


                </div>
                <p>
                    According to the Italian <a href='https://www.quotidianosanita.it/allegati/allegato2421529.pdf'
                        target='_blank'>research institute CENSIS</a>, 1.5 million people were involved in healthcare
                    migration. Of these, around 950,000 were patients, and 825,000 family members or friends
                    accompanying
                    them. Only <a
                        href='http://www.casamica.it/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Ricerca-Casamica-Censis.pdf'
                        target='_blank'>a minority</a> are “accidental” healthcare migrants: tourists, or people who
                    moved
                    but
                    didn’t change their residence, fall in this category. Over 96% are people like Luca and his
                    mother: people who are forced to travel to receive treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The map of healthcare migration flows bears a striking resemblance to the history of Italian
                    migrations.
                    In addition to cross-border flows within the same area, at least 179,000 people moved from the South
                    to the
                    North
                    in 2017; 152,000 from the South to the centre; 82,000 from the Centre to the North. CENSIS estimates
                    suggest the numbers might be higher.</p>

                <div id='migrationFlow' class='chart'></div>

                <p>
                    In total, around half a million people from the Mezzogiorno travelled for their medical care in
                    2017.
                    The North-South route, on the other hand, is almost non-existent. This pattern is consistent with
                    many
                    migration flows in Italy. Given the disparities in the Italian healthcare system, this isn’t a
                    surprise.
                    Patients at hospitals in the South report consistently lower satisfaction rates than those
                    hospitalised
                    in the north. More than that, people don’t trust the public system and the quality of the services
                    it
                    provides.</p>
                <p>
                    “No, I don’t trust my local hospital so much, even though I don’t really go there that often,” says
                    Claudia, 28, from Orani, Sardinia. “I realise it isn’t rational, but I guess negative memories or
                    rumours stick more than happy endings. When your health is at stake, you don’t really want to take
                    any
                    chances. You may come across a good and caring doctor, or you may fall into the hands of someone who
                    doesn’t care about you, doesn’t talk to you, doesn’t help you through your journey there. I’ve felt
                    estranged – as if I wasn’t more than a number. And yet, my mum ended up in hospital last year, and
                    she
                    had a wonderful experience. It’s an irrational fear sometimes, it’s an instinct. You hear so many
                    stories you end up losing trust in the doctors, in the system as a whole.”</p>
                <p>
                    The feeling of abandonment and mistrust is what pushes people to book a plane ticket or board their
                    car,
                    and travel hundreds of kilometres to find better treatments. The professional relationship between a
                    patient and the medical staff is imbued with new resentments and emotions, especially when someone’s
                    health is on the line. Southern patients’ experiences with and feelings towards the local healthcare
                    system are one of the biggest ‘push’ factors in healthcare migration.</p>
                <h2>Who is migrating?</h2>

                <p>
                    Giampietro calls himself a ‘healthcare tourist’.</p>
                <p>
                    “If you don’t laugh about it, what can you do?”. Giampietro, who is 27, has migrated across
                    hospitals
                    for most of his life. He has a chronic condition called cystic fibrosis, which requires constant
                    monitoring and extensive care. When he was 15, he was admitted to the hospital in Nuoro, Sardinia,
                    for a
                    particularly aggressive chest infection. The doctors were puzzled. As he got worse, they eventually
                    advised he and his family visit a specialist centre in Verona, in the north-west of Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    “I go there every year, twice a year now. I stay there for a couple of weeks at a time, I run all
                    the
                    tests, do my daily physiotherapy. I quite like it there, it’s like a small community. You get to
                    know
                    all the doctors and the nurses there, you become friends with other patients.”</p>
                <p>
                    Giampietro is a textbook healthcare migrant. Though cancer patients are a majority (43%), followed
                    by
                    patients with heart conditions (26%), those with chronic illnesses account for about a quarter of
                    admissions (24%). Healthcare migrants <a
                        href='https://www.quotidianosanita.it/allegati/allegato2421529.pdf' target='_blank'>cite</a> the
                    quality of care and long waiting lists as the main
                    reasons to migrate. According to a <a
                        href='http://www.cergas.unibocconi.it/wps/wcm/connect/4d672e28-8ab7-4ebc-94ad-c34803eeee23/CERGAS_Mappatura+Mobilit%C3%A0.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=lPG38C3&CVID=lPG38C3&CVID=lPG38C3&CVID=lPG38C3'
                        target='_blank'>2014 study</a> by CERGAS at the Bocconi university, they are also more
                    likely to access private healthcare. While private and contracted facilities received about a
                    quarter of
                    all resident admissions, they accounted for nearly half of long-distance migrants’ admissions.</p>
                <p>
                    The framing of healthcare migration as a choice or “tourism” is inflammatory. After all, Italy
                    should
                    provide universal public healthcare for all citizens. Healthcare mobility is the pragmatic
                    expression of
                    a right enshrined in law: to guarantee citizens’ freedom to express their right to access to the
                    highest
                    level of care available.</p>
                <p>
                    With twenty regional healthcare systems offering widely different services and quality standards,
                    healthcare migration has become a necessity, rather than a choice for some. Some hospitals have been
                    forced to turn away patients like Luca, unable to provide the required care.</p>
                <p>
                    People with chronic conditions like Giampietro also struggle to receive appropriate care near their
                    home. There are 20 cystic fibrosis centres in Italy – one for each region – but not all of them are
                    equipped to deal with many complications of the condition. “With cystic fibrosis, every patient is
                    unique. There are few of us living in Sardinia, and when I was first diagnosed, doctors were
                    unfamiliar
                    with cases like mine. They studied the theory, they read it on the books, but they had had few
                    opportunities to put that knowledge into practice. Until a few years ago, my regional centre didn’t
                    even
                    have a physiotherapist, who is crucial for us.”</p>
                <p>
                    As a result of these disparities, patients tend to converge around centralised treatment locations,
                    such
                    as Verona, while the others treatment centres languish. Giampietro enjoys his time in Verona: it’s a
                    pleasant break from daily life in Sardinia, a home away from home. “I do love it in Verona, and I’ve
                    learnt to make the most of my time there. I’m also lucky because my health allows me to travel
                    around,
                    go to concerts and exhibitions, hop on a train and visit cities nearby. But for others, it is a
                    source
                    of unnecessary trauma and expenses.”</p>
                <h3>A necessity… or a privilege?</h3>
                <p>
                    Healthcare migration is a cumbersome and stressful journey, for many – but it’s also an expensive
                    one.
                    Italian healthcare is free or requires a relatively small contribution – called “ticket”, but with
                    transport, board and lodging and more on top of medical costs, expenses can add up quickly. During
                    this
                    time, they often have to take breaks from their job, in some cases becoming unemployed. </p>
                <p>Costs vary
                    significantly depending on the facility – public or private –, the length of the stay, the type of
                    procedures required. Cancer patients, for example, may spend upwards of €1,700 per journey, and up
                    to
                    €7,000 a year, according to CENSIS. Chronic patients are also faced with high expenses, especially
                    if
                    they travel from isolated areas, like Sardinia. “I travel with my mum, and we spend €400 to €500
                    just
                    for the plane tickets, if we’re lucky. In total, we spend €1,000, €1,500 every time. We go there
                    twice,
                    so €2,000 to €3,000 a year.”</p>
                <p>
                    In some cases, patients are entitled to partial refunds. When a given local health service is unable
                    to
                    provide a procedure, patients forced to travel to another region can seek compensation to cover the
                    costs – but it is not guaranteed. “I work in Sardinia, where hospitals aren’t always equipped to
                    treat
                    more complex cases. I’ve had to send several patients to the mainland to receive treatment,”
                    explains a
                    paediatrician who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Sometimes the hospital staff themselves suggest
                    parents take their children to another region. In that case, you can have a refund. But I know some
                    parents who don’t apply for it, even if they’re entitled to it. Sometimes, especially when you’re a
                    parent and you would do anything to make your child feel better, you’re not even thinking about
                    bureaucracy. You don’t have time to walk into an office and file your request.”</p>

                <h2>Reinforcing inequalities</h2>
                <p>
                    Healthcare mobility should encourage competition between regional healthcare systems. Less
                    attractive
                    providers should be compelled to invest more money into their services, improve their quality and
                    treat
                    more patients. When a resident in one region receives healthcare in another region, the latter
                    accumulates a transfer of credit from the resident’s home region. Regional governments settle these
                    flows through political and technical agreements.</p>
                <div id='dotMobility' class='chart'></div>
                <p>
                    This market system should work in theory, but in practice, it reinforces existing imbalances.
                    Regional
                    healthcare services in the Mezzogiorno <a
                        href='http://www.quotidianosanita.it/regioni-e-asl/articolo.php?articolo_id=60080'
                        target='_blank'>owed</a> nearly €1.2 billion in mobility debts in 2018, following a
                    political settlement between regional governments. This compares to the significantly smaller net
                    deficit of the Centre – €263 million – and almost mirrors the North’s net €1.1 billion surplus. The
                    North funnels healthcare funding from the rest of Italy’s regional budgets.</p>
                <p>
                    Only 7 out of 20 providers recorded a surplus: five of them are in the North, two – Tuscany and
                    Umbria –
                    in the Centre, and only one – Molise – is in the South. Together, they held mobility credit for more
                    than €2.8 billion – 60% of all total mobility credit generated in the country. Lombardy alone
                    accumulated nearly €1.2 billion in credit and had the largest net migration surplus.</p>
                <p>
                    The regions with the highest mobility debt, (with the exception of Lazio) are all in the
                    Mezzogiorno.
                    Calabria’s deficit exceeds €302 million, and Campania’s is over €290 million.</p>
                <div id='barMobility' class='chart'></div>
                <p>
                    The healthcare mobility market was worth around €4.6 billion in 2018 for hospitals, up from €3.9
                    billion
                    in 2013. This would indicate patients are moving more or need costlier procedures.</p>

                <p>
                    In the absence of mechanisms to redress healthcare inequalities, the mobility credit system
                    reinforces
                    these disparities, benefiting richer, more attractive regions, and draining resources from those
                    that
                    are already underfunded.</p>
                <p>
                    With more resources in their budgets, these providers get additional funding on top of what they
                    receive
                    from the government. This can give providers the ability to <a
                        href='https://www.camera.it/temiap/2019/05/29/OCD177-4031.pdf' target='_blank'>circumvent public
                        expenditure limits</a>,
                    redistribute resources, recruitment, upgrade services and facilities, or provide highly specialised
                    care. According to a <a
                        href='http://www.ipres.it/it/component/k2/item/30-la-finanza-territoriale-rapporto-2018'
                        target='_blank'>2018 study</a>, regional healthcare systems in the Mezzogiorno rely more on
                    public
                    funding than in the North, because they earn less from other sources – like interregional mobility.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Healthcare migration creates a vicious cycle for regional healthcare systems in the Mezzogiorno.
                    They
                    are charged with a double expenditure, having to fund their own providers while paying for services
                    in
                    other regions. They are forced to cut budgets for equipment, clinics, staff. This in turn means they
                    become less attractive among residents. What is more, they are allocated less bedspace because they
                    have
                    negative net migration.</p>
                <p>
                    Hospital beds have been <a href='https://www.programmazionesanitaria.it/' target='_blank'>slashed by
                        75%</a> since 1981. Between 2010 and 2017 alone, the <a
                        href=' http://www.dati.salute.gov.it/dati/dettaglioDataset.jsp?menu=dati&idPag=96'
                        target='_blank'>total number of
                        hospital beds</a> was cut by almost 33,000 – 28,000 of which in the public sector. Calabria and
                    Apulia cut
                    more than 25% of their hospital beds. If the healthcare migrants trend continues to grow, the
                    Mezzogiorno, the gap will worsen.</p>

                <p>
                    In 2017, the Regions and Autonomous Provinces’ Conference – a coordination mechanism between
                    regional
                    governments – <a
                        href='http://www.quotidianosanita.it/governo-e-parlamento/articolo.php?articolo_id=48157'
                        target='_blank'>agreed to introduce</a> some form of compensation in overall funding to account
                    for material
                    deprivation and lower-than-average life expectancy. Some local governments, however, are advocating
                    for
                    stronger performance-based rewards, which go in the opposite direction.</p>
                <p>

                    Patients and their families end up suffering from this unequal mechanism. While some hospitals go
                    deserted, others are over capacity. The Verona centre, for example, is not accepting new patients
                    for
                    the time being, which means people like Giampietro, with more severe forms of cystic fibrosis, will
                    have
                    to migrate elsewhere.</p>
                <p></p>
                Cystic fibrosis is also an example of how inequalities can be overcome, with the right people. According
                to Dr. Carlo Castellani, specialist and director of the cystic fibrosis centre at the Gaslini hospital
                in Genoa, standards have vastly improved in the last twenty years. “Some centres made a political and
                strategic choice – networking with the latecomers, those facilities with fewer capabilities and
                expertise, to nurture that knowledge in-house. In time, these centres caught up with their more
                established partners, and they are now able to guarantee the same level of care. Now more and more
                patients are returning to the centres in their region.”</p>
                <p>
                    Some procedures, like lung transplant, are still rare in parts of the South; but as Dr. Castellani
                    is
                    keen to underline, it isn’t a reflection on doctors’ skills and performance. “There are cultural and
                    social issues at play, like a very low number of donors in this case. The most significant problem
                    is
                    the lack of resources, which makes it impossible to plan radical overhauls and invest in
                    innovation.”
                    Giampietro, as someone with a chronic disease, is a so-called “expert patient”: he’s become very
                    good at
                    being his own doctor, in many ways. He also believes networking is key to improve care.</p>
                <p>
                    “For hospitals dealing with diseases like ours, it isn’t enough to study the subject in the books.
                    You
                    need to build a medical culture around it… It takes initiative from doctors, and willingness to grow
                    talent and expertise in this subject. There are about 5,000 of us [with cystic fibrosis] in Italy.
                    With
                    well-functioning regional centres, each of us could receive care without having to travel long
                    distances
                    with our families.”</p>
                <p>
                    These knowledge networks benefit both doctors and patients. But these efforts alone cannot close the
                    healthcare gap. A strong political commitment is needed from both the national and the regional
                    governments. “We need a broader network with a strategic direction, and that can only come from the
                    government,” explains Dr. Castellani. And of course we need more investments, because the healthcare
                    system is starved for money, in the North and South alike."</p>
