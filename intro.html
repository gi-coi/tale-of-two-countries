                <h2>Italy's life expectancy gap</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    At the two extremities of the Italian peninsula are Bolzano, the northernmost province, and Sicily,
                    a
                    Mediterranean island off the coast of Tunisia. This distance is not merely physical – Bolzano and
                    Sicily
                    also find themselves at the opposing ends of the EU’s poverty rankings.
                    Sicily, at 52%, has the highest poverty rate in the European Union, while Bolzano, at 8.5%, has the
                    lowest. The average disposable income for a Sicilian household is €12,500; a family in Bolzano has
                    almost twice as much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A boy born in Palermo, Sicily, has an average life expectancy of 79 years. The same boy born in
                    Bolzano
                    will live around 2 years longer. While girls may fare a little better, this gap is wider: 83 years
                    in
                    Palermo, 86 in Bolzano.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For centuries before Italian reunification, the story of Bolzano and Palermo was one of two
                    different
                    countries. The borders may be no longer there, but the spectre remains.</p>
                <p>
                    An invisible line cuts across the Italian peninsula. This border is the product of opinions,
                    cultures,
                    identities and self-perceptions. Sometimes it’s above Lazio, bordering the green hills of Tuscany.
                    More
                    often it is right in the middle, between Lazio and Campania.</p>

                <p>
                    Below this invisible border is the Mezzogiorno, a term that encompasses the whole of Southern Italy
                    and
                    Sardinia. It means “noon” in English and refers to the position and intensity of sunshine in
                    Southern
                    Italy at midday. In time, this geographical label has almost become an identity, so strong there is
                    no
                    corresponding definition for the other parts of Italy. It’s just the Mezzogiorno, and the rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has also been, and still is, a pressing political problem. The Southern question, which
                    generations
                    of politicians have tried to answer, is no more than this: why is the Mezzogiorno so poor and
                    backward?
                    What can be done to erase this gap?

                </p>
                <h2>A never-ending crisis</h2>
                <p>
                    The north-south economic gap has been an inaugural feature of the developing Italian state –
                    resulting in an ever-broadening wellbeing gap.

                </p>


                <p>
                    With a median income almost half of their northern counterparts, households in the south are at a
                    higher risk of poverty. Though most of the population lives in the North, nearly half of households
                    in poverty live in the Mezzogiorno. The South of Italy is one of the poorest areas in the European
                    Union, on par with the Southern Spain and parts of eastern Europe.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Economic disparities compound an unequal income distribution even further. More than half of the
                    population in the south and islands inhabits the two lower income quintiles. Average disposable
                    income
                    is around 60% that of the North and has been so since 2004. Incomes have grown by about 10% since
                    the
                    early 2000s but have stagnated since 2008.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The economic crisis dealt a particularly hard blow the Italian economy, with the Mezzogiorno bearing
                    a
                    heavy burden. Recovery has been difficult and disproportionate, and the gap between North and South,
                    if
                    anything, continues to grow. Poverty has doubled compared to pre-crisis levels, with one in ten
                    southern
                    households living below the poverty line. Unemployment, which had declined significantly up until
                    2009,
                    is now back to the early 2000s levels, and exceeds 20% in Campania, Calabria and Sicily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For young
                    people growing up in the South, the crisis isn’t over. And they feel it will never end. Almost one
                    third
                    of those aged 15 to 24 living in Sicily, Calabria and Campania are NEET, (not in employment,
                    education
                    or training). In these regions youth unemployment exceeds 50%.</p>

                <p>
                    “The crisis has been there for as long as I can remember,” says A., 24 years old, Cagliari. She is a
                    graduate in foreign languages but is struggling to find a job in her field. She’s worked a part-time
                    job
                    at a restaurant to support her studies. “My family and I have sacrificed a lot for this degree. I
                    don’t
                    want this to go to waste. I don’t know what to do, I’d like to move to Milan and look for a job
                    there,
                    but it’s so expensive. I wouldn’t want to live my family, the city I grew up in, but I see no future
                    here.”

                </p>
                <h2>Prophecy by postcode</h2>
                <p>Numbers are informative, but they can feel a bit dry. So, how do they translate into years, and
                    health, lost?
                    Socio-economic background and living standards are strictly related. According to the <a
                        href='https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death'
                        target='_blank'>World Health Organisation</a>, noncommunicable diseases, like cancer and heart
                    conditions, are becoming more common.
                    They cause more than 70% of deaths worldwide, and 88% in countries with higher incomes, where they
                    disproportionately affect poorer groups.
                </p>

                <div id='deathCausesIT' class='chart'></div>

                <p>Individuals with lower income are more vulnerable to illness and trauma that might otherwise be
                    avoidable. A lack of access to health care (or inadequate healthcare), means people tend to get
                    sicker, more frequently, their symptoms tend to be more intractable and thus they are more likely to
                    die, because of diminished access to regular check-ups. People of the south are often more
                    susceptible to lifestyle-related diseases, which can be the product of a lower economic background.
                    Lack of access to cheap and healthy food options, for example, correlates with malnutrition and
                    excess weight. These, in turn, increase the risk for a range of chronic conditions, like type 2
                    diabetes. In the workplace, individuals may be exposed to health hazards without any protection.
                </p>
                <p>It is no coincidence that people living in the Mezzogiorno will live shorter lives, and are
                    typically less healthy than average. The gap in life expectancy is around 2 years, but that in
                    healthy life expectancy – that is, without disabilities and functional limitations – is a lot wider.
                    In 2000, a newborn child could expect to live almost 50 healthy years if he or she was born in
                    Sicily or Sardinia, and about 51 if they in Lombardy or Piedmont. By 2013, the gap had widened to 4
                    years: 56 in the Mezzogiorno, and 60 in the North. Life expectancy in the South has grown 30% slower
                    than in the North.</p>
                <div id='income_age' class='chart'></div>
                <p>
                    In addition, more people also report being in bad health: almost 1 in 10 people over 14 in the
                    Mezzogiorno have reported a physical or mental health condition - twice as many as in the North.</p>


                <h2>How to save a life</h2>
                <p>
                    All these factors – lifestyle, environment, prevention, quality of healthcare – have profound
                    negative
                    effects on healthcare outcomes. When combined, they can be deadly, resulting in a stagnating life
                    expectancy, and in deaths that might have been prevented, with adequate planning and public health
                    policies.</p>
                <div id='exp_vis' class='chart'></div>
                <p>
                    The Italian research institute <a href='https://www.mortalitaevitabile.it' target='_blank'>Nebo
                        Ricerche PA</a> uses national and EU data to produce data on avoidable
                    mortality at the regional and province level. The team employs a methodology in which healthcare
                    outcomes are weighted by age: deaths at a younger age count more towards the final score. The result
                    is
                    almost a health ranking - though the goal is not to shame health authorities, according to Nebo
                    Ricerche’s scientific director Dr. Natalia Buzzi.</p>
                <p>
                    The institute flags public health issues and encourages the Italian NHS to critically assess its
                    prevention and care strategies. “We want to draw attention to these issues,” Dr. Buzzi
                    explains. “Why do some areas perform consistently worse than others, what methods can they borrow
                    from
                    others with significantly better rates?”.</p>
                <p>
                    Preventable deaths they still make up a majority of deaths up to 75 years of age. Of the 153,000
                    deaths
                    in 2016, 101,000 were classed as avoidable, resulting in a remarkable loss of potential life
                    expectancy
                    of almost 20 days per capita.</p>
                <p>
                    The institute identified three main areas of focus: prevention through lifestyle, prevention through
                    early diagnosis, and prevention through care and therapy. Lifestyle is mostly down to the individual
                    choices and opportunities, while ensuring good structures and optimal efficiency of healthcare
                    systems
                    is gift of healthcare authorities, and key in ensuring high-quality diagnosis and care.</p>
                <p>The data shows a stark North-South gap in amenable deaths, or deaths that could have been prevented
                    with
                    medical care. These account for a third of all avoidable deaths. Predictably, the regions of the
                    Mezzogiorno record the majority of the worst rates in the country. While the north does have
                    isolated
                    areas of poor performance, it should be noted that changes in the latter may not be statistically
                    significant due to the small numbers involved.</p>
                <p>
                    This indicator strongly correlates with the organisation of local healthcare precincts, Dr. Buzzi
                    notes.
                    “The NHS’ mission is to guarantee universal care to all citizens, regardless of where they live.
                    Instead, the data suggests there is a significant regional divide in the quality and effectiveness
                    of
                    the healthcare system.” And even though preventable deaths have declined in the last years, progress
                    has
                    been slower in the south.</p>
                <p>
                    As Dr. Buzzi highlights, the North-South gap in preventable deaths is consistent with several health
                    and
                    economic phenomena, where the South is systematically at a disadvantage. Unfortunately, while
                    preventable deaths are becoming a priority across the European Union, the issue isn’t a high on the
                    agenda of Italy’s politicians. Several regional governments and local health authorities are using
                    MEVI
                    data to shape and revise their prevention strategy; meanwhile in Rome, Nebo's reports fall on deaf
                    ears.</p>
                <p>Screenings and awareness campaigns may cost money, but they are still a lot cheaper than therapy.
                    “They
                    say an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure, and it’s not just a figure of speech,”
                    emphasises Dr. Buzzi. “The budget savings for the healthcare system are enormous. Not to mention the
                    human costs.”</p>
                <p>
                    Intelligence and planning could go a long way in saving at least some of these lives in the future.
                    But
                    without proper funding, it won’t be possible to support a proper long-term prevention strategy.</p>
