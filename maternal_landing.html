                <h2>Maternal care</h2>
                <p>

                    Maternal care has made enormous strides in Italy. According to ISTAT, almost 400,000 children, or
                    one in two, died before the age of 5, mostly from infectious diseases. By 2011, this number had
                    dropped to 2,084.
                </p>
                <p>Today, Italy has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in EU – and in the
                    world. Improving life conditions and levels of education allow parents and their children have a
                    safer, healthier life. Furthermore, enormous strides have been made in improving access to and
                    quality of the healthcare system. A specific focus on prevention, coupled with technological and
                    scientific progress, make it easier to monitor each stage of pregnancy and the child’s early life,
                    to spot risk factors and prevent complications.
                </p>
                <p> Today, pregnant women and their children are safer, in the north and south alike. The mortality gap,
                    however, still exists and hasn’t shrunk significantly over the last ten years. A newborn child is
                    still 40% more likely to die in the Mezzogiorno than in the north of the country.

                </p>
                <h3>Why does this happen?</h3>
                <p>Income, educational attainment and socio-economic background are all factors that influence the
                    quality of life – and, as a consequence, the quality of a pregnancy.
                    The wealth gap between the north and the south of Italy disproportionately affects women, who tend
                    to have lower disposable income, are less likely to be employed and are generally less financially
                    independent than men.</p>
                <p>
                    With enough income and job security, a pregnant
                    woman can afford a healthier lifestyle, she is able to access appropriate care, attend regular
                    check-ups, buy supplements and drugs, and take time off work, if she needs to. Material deprivation,
                    physical and psychological stress can lead to early pregnancy termination and can affect both the
                    woman and the child’s health after birth.</p>
                <p>The quality and proximity of adequate maternal care is just as important. This means having
                    appropriate, tailored care through the pregnancy and in the first months after birth; offering
                    specialist care for high-risk pregnancies; having a prevention strategy in place that supports women
                    in leading a healthy lifestyle and delivering safely, planning against complications; putting
                    measures in place to detect and deal with post-partum-depression. Crucially, it means building a
                    support network around pregnant women and new parents.</p>
                <p>Though access to healthcare is a universal right enshrined in Italian constitutional law, the
                    economic realities of recession and funding cuts have forced providers to slash their budgets,
                    cutting services and personnel. Maternal care units have undergone significant restructuring since
                    2010, raising issues of access in deprived and isolated areas, especially in the Mezzogiorno.</p>
